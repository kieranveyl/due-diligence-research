- **NEW**: Comprehensive documentation in `docs/` directory:
  - Getting Started guide with installation and setup
  - Research Guide with advanced techniques
  - Configuration Guide with detailed options
  - Reports Management guide
  - Complete CLI Reference documentation
  - System Overview with architecture details
  - Quick Start Examples for practical usage
- **NEW**: Smart entity detection (company vs person vs organization)
- **NEW**: Multi-scope research (financial, legal, osint, verification)
- **NEW**: Professional report generation in multiple formats
- **NEW**: System health checks and API key validation
- **NEW**: Graceful error handling with fallback implementations
- **NEW**: Demo mode functionality for users without API keys

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced Typer with Click due to rich integration compatibility issues
- **BREAKING**: `src/cli/main.py` - Complete rewrite using Click framework
- **MAJOR**: CLI entry point now uses pure Click avoiding Parameter.make_metavar() errors
- **MAJOR**: All help commands now work correctly without rich formatting conflicts
- **IMPROVED**: CLI provides immediate value with working commands
- **IMPROVED**: Rich tables and UI components work properly
- **IMPROVED**: Better error messages and user guidance

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `Parameter.make_metavar() missing 1 required positional argument: 'ctx'` error
- **CRITICAL**: Help system now works correctly (`dd --help`, `dd research --help`, etc.)
- **CRITICAL**: All subcommands execute successfully
- **CRITICAL**: Rich UI components render properly without style conflicts
- **MAJOR**: CLI installation and execution works out of the box
- **MAJOR**: Configuration system handles missing API keys gracefully
- **MAJOR**: Report generation works with proper file handling

### Documentation

- **COMPREHENSIVE**: Created complete documentation suite in `docs/` directory
- **USER-FOCUSED**: Documentation emphasizes practical usage over code details
- **STRUCTURED**: Clear navigation with user guides, design docs, and examples
- **ACTIONABLE**: Step-by-step guides for all major workflows
- **REFERENCE**: Complete CLI command documentation with all options

### Technical Implementation

**CLI Framework:**
- Click 8.x for command handling
- Rich 13.x for UI components (properly integrated)
- Pydantic for configuration management
- JSON for session and config persistence

**Command Structure:**
- `dd research run` - Main research command with full options
- `dd config show/set/validate/reset` - Configuration management
- `dd reports list/show/export/cleanup` - Report management
- `dd health` - System diagnostics
- `dd version` - Version information

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Interactive and non-interactive research modes
- ✅ Customizable research scope and parameters
- ✅ Session saving and resuming
- ✅ Report generation and management
- ✅ Configuration with API key validation
- ✅ System health monitoring
- ✅ Rich progress displays and tables
- ✅ Help system with complete documentation

**Next Steps:**
- Integration with actual LangGraph workflows
- Real API connections to OpenAI and Exa
- Advanced report templates and visualization
- Multi-agent research execution

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX - Initial Release (Non-Functional)

### Added

- Initial project structure with LangGraph-based multi-agent architecture
- CLI framework using Click for command-line interface
- Multi-agent system with specialized research agents:
    - Financial Agent for financial analysis and SEC filings
    - Legal Agent for compliance and litigation research
    - OSINT Agent for digital footprint analysis
    - Verification Agent for fact-checking and source validation
- Configuration management system with JSON-based settings
- Session management for research persistence
- Report generation in multiple formats (Markdown, JSON, PDF planning)
- Rich UI components for progress tracking and user interaction
- Docker containerization support
- Comprehensive test suite framework

### Known Issues

- CLI commands fail to execute due to required API key configuration
- Research workflow is mock-only and doesn't perform actual analysis
- Database dependencies (PostgreSQL/Redis) prevent local development
- Import issues and circular dependencies in module structure
- LangGraph workflow compilation issues
- Missing error handling for API failures

### Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with async support
- **Workflow**: LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **CLI**: Click-based command interface
- **UI**: Rich library for terminal interfaces
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT models with Exa search integration
- **Storage**: Vector database for research context

### Documentation

- Comprehensive DESIGN.md with system architecture
- README.md with installation and usage instructions
- CLI help system and command documentation

### Phase 1 Resolution Summary

**Problem:** CLI was completely non-functional due to:

- Required API keys causing startup failures
- Mock-only implementations with no real functionality
- Import dependency issues and circular references
- Hard database dependencies preventing local development

**Solution:** Comprehensive Phase 1 refactor implementing:

- Optional API keys with graceful degradation
- Working demo mode with realistic sample analysis
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Simple entry point script (`cli.py`) that "just works"
- No external service dependencies for basic functionality

**Result:** CLI now provides immediate value to users and can be extended incrementally with real API integrations in Phase 2.
