Design & UI/UX Clarification Questions:

1. **CLI User Experience Flow:**
    - Should the CLI default to interactive mode with rich prompts, or batch processing mode?
      Answer: Interactive mode with rich prompts is preferred
    - How should progress be displayed - live updating bars, step-by-step logs, or minimal output?
      Answer: Live updating bars are preferred for interactive mode, while minimal output is preferred for batch processing mode
    - What's the preferred information hierarchy in reports - executive summary first, or detailed findings?
      Answer: The report should start with an executive summary followed by detailed findings, providing a clear overview of the findings in a structured manner.

2. **Agent Workflow Design:**
    - Should agents run truly in parallel, or in a dependency chain (e.g., Research → Financial → Legal → Verification)?
      Answer: So, initially a single agent should do a BROAD sweep of the web to determine what agents and their tasks are required. Then, depending on the results, additional agents can be launched to perform specific tasks in either parallel or sequential order, depending on the dependencies between tasks.
    - How should conflicting information between agents be presented to users?
      Answer: Conflicting information should be presented in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the differences and providing a summary of the conflicting information. Users should be able to easily identify the source of the conflicting information and make an informed decision.
    - What confidence threshold should trigger user review vs. automatic completion?
      Answer: The confidence threshold should be set based on the importance of the information and the potential impact of incorrect information. For critical information, a higher threshold should be set to ensure accuracy, while for less critical information, a lower threshold can be used to save time.

3. **Report Structure & Format:**
    - What's the ideal report structure for different user types (executives vs. analysts)?
      Answer: It should be a simple and easy-to-read format that includes all relevant information in a clear and concise manner dependent on the query.
    - Should reports be interactive (clickable sections) or static documents?
      Answer: They should be physical documents, MD or PDF that are configurable, then stored for latter. The PLAN by the planner should be stored and then updated as items are competed. The plan should be displayed in the terminal as check lists and updated as items are completed.
    - How should citations and source confidence be displayed?
      Answer: Citations should be displayed in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the source of the information and the confidence level of the source. Source confidence should be displayed as a percentage or a rating scale, with a clear explanation of what each rating means.

4. **Error Handling UX:**
    - When APIs fail, should the system show partial results or wait for all agents?
      Answer: The system should show partial results and wait for all agents to complete their tasks before displaying the final result.
    - How should API rate limiting be communicated to users?
      Answer: API rate limiting should be communicated to users in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the maximum number of requests allowed per time period and the consequences of exceeding the limit.
    - What level of technical detail should error messages contain?
      Answer: Error messages should contain enough information to help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it, but not so much that they become overwhelming. The level of detail should be appropriate for the user's level of technical expertise.
      ACTUAL UI/UX Flow Design Questions:\*\*

### **1. Initial Launch & Authentication Flow:**

- **First-time user setup:** Should the CLI walk users through API key configuration with an interactive setup wizard, or expect them to configure via `.env` files first?
  Answer: .env
- **Command structure:** Do you prefer a single entry point like `dd research "Tesla Inc"` or subcommands like `dd research run "Tesla Inc"`?
  Answer: dd research run "Generate a comprehensive report about the life and career of Farhad Azima, focusing on government and intelligence work around the world."
- **Help discovery:** How should users discover available commands and options - inline suggestions, `--help` everywhere, or separate `dd help` command?
  Answer: `--help` .

### **2. Research Initialization & Planning Phase:**

- **Query analysis display:** When the initial broad-sweep agent analyzes the query, should it show a real-time "thinking" animation with discovered entities, or just a progress spinner until done?
  Answer: Thinking with discoveries, overview, etc.
- **Plan presentation:** Should the generated research plan be displayed as:
    - A simple numbered list with checkboxes?
    - A hierarchical tree view showing dependencies?
    - A timeline/gantt chart showing parallel vs sequential tasks?

Answer: A hierarchical tree view showing dependencies

- **Plan approval:** Should users be able to modify the generated plan interactively (add/remove agents, adjust priorities) before execution starts?
  Answer: Yes, after the plan is generated, users can make changes to via a query, then it should generate a new plan and display it for approval again.

### **3. Live Progress Display & Task Execution:**

- **Multi-agent status:** With multiple agents running in parallel, should the display show: - Separate progress bars for each agent stacked vertically? - A single overall progress bar with current agent highlighted? - A dashboard-style grid showing all agents with mini progress indicators?
  Answer: It should should the plan, simplified, and then status on the agents working on each task until completion.
- **Task granularity:** Should progress show high-level agent status ("Financial Analysis: 60%") or detailed subtasks ("Fetching SEC 10-K filing for Q3 2024")?
  Answer: It should show detailed subtasks.
- **Live results preview:** Should partial results appear in real-time as agents complete subtasks, or only show completed agent results?
  Answer: It should show partial results in real-time as agents complete subtasks.

### **4. Conflict Resolution & User Interaction:**

- **Confidence threshold triggers:** When conflicting information is found, should the CLI:
    - Pause execution and prompt for user input immediately?
    - Continue collecting all conflicts and present them together at the end?
    - Show conflicts in a separate window/pane while continuing execution?
- **Conflict presentation format:** Should conflicts be shown as: - Side-by-side comparison tables? - Timeline view showing contradictory information by date? - Source reliability ranking with confidence scores?
  Answer: It should show whichever the report agent believes is most appropriate.
- **User decision capture:** How should users resolve conflicts - select preferred source, mark as "needs further investigation", or weight different sources?
  Answer: They shouldn't, the final report should show the conflicts CLEARLY and then they decide.

### **5. Report Generation & Final Output:**

- **Report building display:** Should report generation show:
    - A preview that updates in real-time as sections are completed?
    - A simple progress indicator until the full report is ready?
    - A structured outline that fills in as content is generated?
      Answer: Progress bar for now.
- **Citation integration:** Should citations appear:
    - As footnotes at the bottom of each section?
    - As inline confidence indicators (e.g., "[Source: SEC Filing, 95% confidence]")?
    - In a separate appendix with reference numbers throughout the text?

    Answer: Inline confidence indicators and separate appendix.

- **Format selection:** Should users choose output format (MD/PDF) before or after research completion, and should they see a preview before final generation?
  Answer: After research completion, it should already have written it to a file in MD. Once it says the report is ready, it should offer to convert it to PDF interactively.

### **6. Session Management & Resume Functionality:**

- **Session persistence:** Should the CLI automatically save sessions, or require users to explicitly use `--save-session`?
- **Resume interface:** When resuming, should users see: - The original plan with completed items checked off? - A summary of what was completed vs what remains? - The option to modify the remaining plan before continuing?
  Answer: The plan with completed items checked off. and then a summary of what's next and the ability to modify the remaining plan before continuing.
- **Session browsing:** How should users browse previous sessions - list view, search by entity name, or filter by date/status?

### **7. Error Handling & Recovery Flows:**

- **API failure presentation:** When external APIs fail, should errors show:
    - Technical details for debugging?
    - User-friendly explanations with suggested actions?
    - Progressive disclosure (simple message + "Show details" option)?
- **Partial failure handling:** If 2 of 4 agents succeed, should the CLI:
    - Generate a partial report immediately with clear disclaimers?
    - Offer to retry failed agents or continue with different agents?
    - Show what data is missing and its impact on the analysis?
- **Rate limiting feedback:** Should rate limit notifications:
    - Show countdown timers until the next request is allowed?
    - Suggest alternative data sources or cached information?
    - Allow users to queue requests for later automatic retry?

### **8. Advanced User Customization:**

- **Confidence threshold adjustment:** Should this be:
    - A global setting in configuration?
    - Per-agent customizable (stricter for legal, looser for OSINT)?
    - Adjustable per query based on use case?
- **Output verbosity levels:** Should the CLI support:
    - Silent mode (minimal output, results only)?
    - Standard mode (progress + summary)?
    - Verbose mode (detailed agent logs + debugging info)?
    - Expert mode (raw API responses + confidence calculations)?

\*\*Which aspects of this flow are most critical for your use case, and how do you envision users primarily interacting with the system?
